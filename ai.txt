## CachyOS Desktop Support

We recommend and support CachyOS with KDE Plasma for Linux desktop users looking to break free from Windows.

### About CachyOS

CachyOS is a lightweight, Arch Linux-based distribution emphasizing performance, security, and user-friendliness. All packages compiled with x86-64-v3/v4 instruction sets and LTO optimization, with core packages enhanced using PGO and BOLT for measurably faster performance.

### Why Switch from Windows

Windows 11's hardware requirements have left millions of computers behind. CachyOS runs beautifully on older hardware, respects your privacy, and puts you in control. No telemetry, no mandatory cloud accounts, no subscriptions.

### KDE Plasma Desktop

KDE Plasma 6.5 offers a familiar Windows-like experience with taskbar, start menu, and system tray. Wayland default with smooth animations, HDR support, and excellent multi-monitor handling.

### ZFS Filesystem

CachyOS offers ZFS directly from the graphical installer. Built-in RAID with self-healing, instant snapshots, transparent compression, and the legendary ARC cache. Roll back your entire system in seconds.

### Installation Guide

CachyOS installs in under an hour using the Calamares installer. Firefox for browsing, LibreOffice for documents, thousands of free applications.

Step 1: Download CachyOS KDE Plasma edition from cachyos.org
Step 2: Create bootable USB with Rufus (rufus.ie)
Step 3: Boot from USB (F12/F2/Del at startup)
Step 4: Run installer, select Erase disk, create username/password
Step 5: Restart and enjoy your new Linux desktop

We provide full CachyOS support from installation to ongoing maintenance.
