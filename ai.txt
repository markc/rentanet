## CachyOS Desktop Support

We recommend and support CachyOS with KDE Plasma for Linux desktop users looking to break free from Windows.

CachyOS is a lightweight, Arch Linux-based distribution emphasising performance, security, and user-friendliness. All packages compiled with x86-64-v3/v4 instruction sets and LTO optimisation, with core packages enhanced using PGO and BOLT for measurably faster performance than generic Linux distributions.

Windows 11's hardware requirements have left millions of computers behind. CachyOS runs beautifully on older hardware, respects your privacy completely, and puts you in control. No telemetry, no mandatory cloud accounts, no subscriptions.

KDE Plasma 6.5 offers a familiar Windows-like experience with taskbar, start menu, and system tray. Wayland is the default display protocol with smooth animations, HDR support, and excellent multi-monitor handling.

CachyOS offers ZFS directly from the Calamares graphical installer. Built-in RAID with self-healing, instant snapshots, transparent compression, and the legendary ARC cache. Roll back your entire system in seconds.

Installation takes under an hour. Firefox for browsing, LibreOffice for documents, thousands of free applications available immediately.

We provide full CachyOS support from installation to ongoing maintenance.
