## Hosting Platforms

### Alpine Linux LXC Containers

Ultra-lightweight containers running on Proxmox VE. Alpine Linux provides an 8MB container base with no bloatware, fast boot times, and lower hosting costs. The security-focused design offers a minimal attack surface with musl libc hardening, regular security updates, and PaX/grsecurity readiness. Performance is near bare-metal speed with efficient resource usage, high container density, and instant scaling. Perfect for Laravel with PHP 8.3 FPM optimized, Composer pre-installed, Redis/MySQL ready, all in approximately 40MB total image size.

Minimum requirements are just 128MB RAM with approximately 130MB disk footprint, 1-3% overhead versus bare metal, and instant deployment. Ideal for static sites, PHP applications, and email hosting.

### Full Virtual Machines (Debian 12)

Production-ready Debian-powered virtual machines for serious workloads. Running Debian Stable provides a rock-solid foundation with 5-year LTS support, predictable updates, and industry-standard compatibility. The multi-service stack includes Postfix and Dovecot for email, Nginx and PHP-FPM for web, MariaDB or SQLite for databases, and SpamProbe for spam filtering.

These are dedicated resources with complete isolation — not shared VPS slices. Each VM has a dedicated kernel with complete isolation, WordPress optimization, and custom OS support available. Suitable for demanding applications requiring guaranteed resources.

### Combined Web and Email

Single server hosting both web and email services with shared SSL certificate, simplified management, and cost-effective bundling.

Perfect for developers who want to focus on code, not sysadmin.

## CachyOS Desktop Support

We recommend and support CachyOS with KDE Plasma for Linux desktop users looking to break free from Windows.

### About CachyOS

CachyOS is a lightweight, Arch Linux-based distribution that emphasizes performance, security, and user-friendliness. Built with optimized kernels and modern tooling, it delivers exceptional speed while maintaining full compatibility with the extensive Arch User Repository (AUR). All packages are compiled with x86-64-v3/v4 instruction sets and LTO optimization, with core packages further enhanced using PGO and BOLT — resulting in measurably faster performance than generic Linux distributions.

### Why Switch from Windows

Windows 11's hardware requirements have left millions of perfectly good computers behind. Microsoft's aggressive data collection, forced updates, and built-in advertising have frustrated users worldwide. Meanwhile, CachyOS runs beautifully on older hardware, respects your privacy completely, and puts you in control of your own computer. No telemetry, no mandatory cloud accounts, no subscriptions — just a fast, stable operating system that works for you.

### KDE Plasma Desktop

We recommend the KDE Plasma edition of CachyOS. Now at version 6.5, it's the most polished and feature-rich Linux desktop available. Plasma offers a familiar Windows-like experience with a taskbar, start menu, and system tray, but with far greater customization.

Wayland is now the default display protocol, bringing smooth animations, HDR support, and excellent multi-monitor handling. Features include automatic light-to-dark theme switching, fingerprint authentication, floating panels, and virtual desktops. Over 82% of KDE users now run Wayland, and the experience is rock-solid.

### ZFS Filesystem

CachyOS is one of the few distributions offering ZFS directly from the Calamares graphical installer — no command-line required. ZFS brings features previously found only in enterprise storage: built-in RAID with self-healing (RAID-Z), instant snapshots using copy-on-write, transparent compression to save disk space, and the legendary ARC cache that delivers blazing-fast read times on frequently accessed files. Roll back your entire system to any previous snapshot in seconds. For users who value their data, ZFS is the gold standard.

### Why Use a Linux Desktop

Cost-Effective: Free to download and use, no licensing fees, runs on older hardware.

Open Source: Full transparency, community-driven development, endless customization options.

Security and Privacy: Built-in protections, less malware targeted, no user tracking.

Performance: Efficient resource usage, optimized kernels, no bloatware.

### Installation Guide

CachyOS installs in under an hour using the friendly Calamares installer and comes with everything you need: Firefox for browsing, LibreOffice for documents, and thousands of free applications one click away. No subscriptions, no licensing fees, no bloatware. Your familiar keyboard shortcuts work, your files transfer seamlessly, and the learning curve is minimal.

Before starting, back up everything important — photos, documents, anything you want to keep. Copy them to an external drive or cloud storage. Installing CachyOS will erase Windows. You will need a USB stick of 8GB or larger and about 30-60 minutes.

Step 1 - Download CachyOS: Visit cachyos.org, click Download, choose KDE Plasma (it's the most Windows-like), and save the .iso file.

Step 2 - Create a bootable USB: Download Rufus from rufus.ie (it's free), plug in your USB stick, open Rufus, click SELECT and choose the CachyOS .iso you downloaded, click START and accept any prompts, then wait for it to finish.

Step 3 - Boot from the USB: Restart your computer with the USB plugged in. As it starts, repeatedly tap F12, F2, or Del (depends on your computer) to get the boot menu. Select your USB stick from the list. CachyOS will load in a minute or two.

Step 4 - Install CachyOS: Once loaded, click Install CachyOS. Choose your language, location, and keyboard layout. When asked about disk/partitioning, select Erase disk (the simple option). Create your username and password. Click through to start installation and wait 10-20 minutes. Click Restart and remove the USB when prompted.

Step 5 - First boot: Your computer will restart into CachyOS. Log in with the password you created. The bottom-left corner is the start menu equivalent. Dolphin is the file manager like File Explorer. Firefox is the web browser. The software center is for installing new apps.

We provide full support for CachyOS with KDE Plasma — from initial installation to ongoing maintenance. Whether you need help migrating from Windows, setting up ZFS snapshots, configuring specific software, or just want guidance as you explore your new system, we have 28+ years of Linux experience ready to assist you.
